You are a professional Python developer experienced in game development.

"Generate a complete Python script for a two-player 'Tic-Tac-Toe' game using the Pygame library. The game should include the following features:

1.  Game Board: 
    - A 3x3 grid representing the Tic-Tac-Toe board, visually drawn in the Pygame window.

2.  Player Turns:
    - Clearly indicate whose turn it is (Player X or Player O).
    - Players alternate turns placing their mark ('X' or 'O') on an empty square by clicking with the mouse.

3.  Input Handling:
    - Detect mouse clicks within the grid squares to place marks.
    - Prevent placing a mark on an already occupied square.

4.  Win Condition:
    - Detect when a player has won (three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal).
    - Display a clear "Player X Wins!" or "Player O Wins!" message.

5.  Draw Condition:
    - Detect when the board is full and no player has won (a draw).
    - Display a "It's a Draw!" message.

6.  Reset Option:
    - After a game ends (win or draw), allow players to restart the game by pressing a key (e.g., 'R' for Reset) or clicking a "Play Again" button.

7.  Basic Graphics:
    - Use simple shapes (lines for the grid, 'X' and 'O' drawn with lines or text) and distinct colors for clarity.

8.  Game Loop:
    - Implement a standard Pygame event loop for handling input, updating game state, and drawing.

Prioritize clean, readable, and well-structured code. Ensure all necessary Pygame imports are included and the game is fully runnable.
